Welcome to the repository of my very first financial management API, crafted with care and a touch of coding magic! This Spring Boot project, which I whipped up a while ago, operates as a microservice dedicated to handling all things finance. Though I can’t pinpoint the exact date, this API was built to bring some serious financial wizardry to life.
